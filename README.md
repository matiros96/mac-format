# mac-format
**Simple Mac-adress parser/formatter written in Python**

*This is just a personal project of me messing around.*

It takes a Mac-adress (any format) and give the choise of outputing it in one of three formats.
1. xxxxxxxxxxxx
2. xxxx-xxxx-xxxx
3. xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx

The script takes two arguments, the first being the actual mac-adress the second being the formatting option (1,2,3) from the list above.
So for example the following line "py macFormat.py E4-43-C4-2B-70-85 3" will output "E4:43:C4:2B:70:85".
